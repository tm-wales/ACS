Huller House – and Cheese Factory – Phase 1
ACS were commissioned over multiple phases, for both the Doff Super heated steam cleaning and Torc soft media blast systems, we were asked to get involved on one of the most specialists projects we have undertaken to date, we were required to steam clean and remove years of contamination from pigeon guano for the main contractor to be able to commission the area for construction development.
Further to successful completion of the 5th floor, we were engaged to clean the remaining 4 floors to assist in delivering the building in a clean and sterile condition, thus enabling the main contractors work force to have a suitable and safe working environment, without the risk of harmful toxins becoming airborne during the construction phase.
