Here is a DOFF case study to show the amazing different with before and after pictures of Cardiff Crown Court.
ACS were commissioned to undertake the sensitive cleaning works in a heavy pedestrian area in Cardiff crown court, we cleaned from 8am to 430pm Monday to Friday with little to no disruption to the general public or any of the staff, utilising our Doff super heated steam cleaning equipment we were able to remove some of the heaviest algae and dirt and grime deposits we have seen on a main entrance steps before.
Not only is this dangerous, but it also makes the centre piece of any building look tired and unwelcoming for its patrons and staff, using only pure steam and no chemicals offering a completely environmentally friendly process, we were able to carry out and complete a sympathetic clean to the area causing no damage to the aged sandstone feature, and present the client with another job well done by ACS making buildings beautiful again.
On the last day of the contract, our staff and operations director were inundated with remarks on the level of cleaning produced and the fact that they were proud to see a tired looking entrance become inviting once more.
