Client – Hill Partnership

Location - London
Service – Shot Blasting 
ACS were called in to carry out on site shot blasting to the pre casted concrete support pillars
The reason for this work was the client had decided he would like to have an exposed aggregate decorative finish to the columns to create a rough cast look, ACS carried out a sample day in January 2018 and subsequently got selected and awarded the contract at the end of February 2018, based on the quality of that sample over three other competitors samples, and then secured the job with competitive pricing and the right attitude.
