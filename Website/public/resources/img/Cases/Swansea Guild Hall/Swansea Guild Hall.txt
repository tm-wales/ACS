Swansea Guild Hall Clock Tower
Working on one of Swansea's most iconic landmarks, the clock tower looks out over Swansea's remarkable coastline and stands proud in the heart of the city centre, using the Doff we were able to clean years of dirt and grime with ease producing an almost as new finish to the spec and delight of Swansea council members.
After this contract had finished we were awarded a second and third phase on the project, and invited to attend the award where the mayor of Swansea paid special tribute to ACS for a job well done.
