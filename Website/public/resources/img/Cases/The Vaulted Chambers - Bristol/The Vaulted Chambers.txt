The Vaulted Chambers - Bristol City Council
ACS were commissioned to remove a large quality on unwanted art work from the facade of a grade 1 listed building, retained in the facade of the building is part of the original Bristol city castle dating back to the 14th century, the council asked us to soft media blast this to expose its natural features which are now on display and we have administered a protective anti-graffiti coating, to prevent unwanted future tag artists making their mark.
Further to completing this works we were also asked to soft media blast the main entrance wooden doors, in an effort to bring them back to their former glory ready for painting.
