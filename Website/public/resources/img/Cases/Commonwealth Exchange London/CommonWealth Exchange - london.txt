Commonwealth Exchange – London 
Working on the commonwealth building was a challenge just to get approved to get on site, undergoing rigorous security checks and meeting the accreditation requirements of the main contractor were hard, but we are proud to say we met the right criteria to carry out the works.
Using our peelaway system designed for works on delicate and intricate stone work, we carried out various samples in a controlled and secure area working only metres away from MP's and Parliament members.
Working in a similar fashion to that of the paint softener listed above, we were able to offer out client a completely mechanical free solution to removing aged paintwork from one of the UK's most prestigious buildings, low noise, low odour, low risk was the name of game and we delivered as promised and on time.
